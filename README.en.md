# Ingilizce-Kelimeler — Auto-Generated English Vocabulary Cards for Obsidian

> An [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault that builds English vocabulary cards automatically. You type a word, a Python script fetches the IPA, part of speech, definition, example sentences, synonyms, and **Turkish translations** — then writes a polished markdown note ready for spaced repetition review.

## Why this exists

Most vocabulary apps give you flashcards. Few do all of these at once:

- Pull data from real dictionary sources (not hand-typed)
- Add Turkish translations automatically (or any second language with one config change)
- Live inside Obsidian so the notes are yours forever
- Work entirely with free, no-key APIs
- Take ~2 seconds per word

This is what I use myself. If it helps you too, that's the bonus.

## What it does

You run:

```bash
python kelime_ekle.py resilient
```

You get a fully populated `Kelimeler/R/resilient.md` in your Obsidian vault, with IPA, part of speech, English + Turkish definition, two example sentences (each with a Turkish translation), synonyms, antonyms, and a Spaced Repetition card.

## How it works

Three free APIs, in order:

1. **[dictionaryapi.dev](https://dictionaryapi.dev)** — IPA, parts of speech, definitions, examples, synonyms/antonyms (built on Wiktionary)
2. **[MyMemory Translation](https://mymemory.translated.net)** — Turkish translation of the word and example sentences
3. **[Tatoeba.org](https://tatoeba.org)** — fallback for example sentences when dictionary has none. Bonus: returns sentences with their human-translated Turkish counterparts.

No API keys. No `pip install`. Just Python 3.8+ and an internet connection.

## Dictionary-style organization

Words are not flat — they're organized **like a real dictionary, A-Z**:

```
Kelimeler/
├── _Sözlük.md          ← A-Z navigation hub
├── A/
│   ├── adopted.md
│   └── appreciate.md
├── E/
│   └── endeavor.md
├── R/
│   └── resilient.md
└── V/
    └── validation.md
```

Open `_Sözlük.md` in Obsidian and you'll see **A B C D E ...** clickable buttons at the top that jump to each letter section. The lists are powered by **Dataview** — when you add a new word, it appears automatically. Zero maintenance.

To convert an existing flat vault to this structure (one-time):
```bash
python vault_alfabetik_organize.py --uygula
```

(`--uygula` means "apply" in Turkish — without it, the script does a dry-run.)

## Quick start

### 1. Clone or download

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Muhammet-Ay/ingilizce-kelimeler.git
cd ingilizce-kelimeler
```

Or open the folder as an Obsidian vault directly.

### 2. Add a word

```bash
cd "Araçlar"
python kelime_ekle.py resilient
```

That's it. Open Obsidian, look in `Kelimeler/R/` — your card is there.

### 3. More options

```bash
# Multiple words at once
python kelime_ekle.py endeavor ubiquitous meticulous

# From a list (edit yeni_kelimeler.txt — one word per line)
python kelime_ekle.py

# Different difficulty level
python kelime_ekle.py validation --seviye advanced

# Re-fetch an existing word
python kelime_ekle.py guidance --overwrite

# Skip Turkish translation (English data only)
python kelime_ekle.py paradigm --no-translate
```

## Companion tools

This repo also ships with:

- **`vault_alfabetik_organize.py`** — converts a flat vault into A-Z dictionary structure + generates `_Sözlük.md`
- **`toplu_ekleme.py`** — bulk-add from a CSV when you already have meanings written
- **`vault_temizle.py`** — flags accidentally-added junk notes ("of", "may", "into" — common function words that don't belong as flashcards) and deletes them on confirmation
- **`eklentileri_kur.ps1` / `.bat`** — one-click installer for 8 useful Obsidian community plugins (Dataview, Templater, Translate, Calendar, Periodic Notes, Excalidraw, Various Complements, Obsidian to Anki). Windows only. Downloads from each plugin's official GitHub release.
- **Obsidian templates** — `Templates/Şablon - Basit/Orta/Detaylı.md` for three difficulty levels (basit = beginner, orta = intermediate, detaylı = advanced)
- **Spaced Repetition compatibility** — every generated card has `#flashcards/english` and `::` separators, ready for the [obsidian-spaced-repetition](https://github.com/st3v3nmw/obsidian-spaced-repetition) plugin

## Customizing for other languages

The script targets Turkish translations by default. To change that, edit two lines at the top of `Araçlar/kelime_ekle.py`:

```python
TRANSLATE_API = "https://api.mymemory.translated.net/get?q={q}&langpair=en|tr"
TATOEBA_API = "https://tatoeba.org/en/api_v0/search?from=eng&to=tur&query={q}&sort=relevance"
```

Change `tr` to `es` (Spanish), `de` (German), `fr` (French), or any [ISO 639-1 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes). Tatoeba uses the [639-3 codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-3_codes) — `tur`, `spa`, `deu`, `fra`.

The markdown template (Turkish labels like "Telaffuz", "Anlam") lives in the `render_md` function in the same file.

## Limitations

- **Internet required.** No offline mode yet. Could be added by bundling a Wiktionary dump.
- **MyMemory daily quota.** ~5,000 words/day. Plenty for personal use; if exceeded, translations come back empty until midnight UTC. Examples from Tatoeba still work.
- **dictionaryapi.dev coverage gaps.** Common technical words sometimes return 404. The script reports it and you can add the entry manually.
- **Windows-first install script.** `eklentileri_kur.ps1` is PowerShell. Mac/Linux users should install Obsidian plugins through the in-app store.
- **`_Sözlük.md` requires Dataview.** Without it, the A-Z buttons render but the lists are empty. The plugin installer sets up Dataview automatically.
